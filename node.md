    - [ ] Thanos is a set of components that can be composed into a highly available metric system with unlimited storage capacity, which can be added seamlessly on top of existing Prometheus deployments.

    - [ ] Thanos is a CNCF Sandbox project.

    - [ ] Thanos leverages the Prometheus 2.0 storage format to cost-efficiently store historical metric data in any object storage while retaining fast query latencies. Additionally, it provides a global query view across all Prometheus installations and can merge data from Prometheus HA pairs on the fly.

    - [ ] Concretely the aims of the project are:

    - [ ] Global query view of metrics.
    - [ ] Unlimited retention of metrics.
