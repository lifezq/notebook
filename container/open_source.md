flannel is a network fabric for containers, designed for Kubernetes     
flannel is a virtual network that gives a subnet to each host for use with container runtimes.     
Platforms like Kubernetes assume that each container (pod) has a unique, routable IP inside the cluster. The advantage of this model is that it reduces the complexity of doing port mapping.
